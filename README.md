An XBMC add-on that controls Philips Hue lights. In "Theatre mode" the add-on dims the the Philips Hue lights as soon as a movie starts playing, and turns the lights back on once the movie is done. "Ambilight mode" turns your Philips Hue lights in a room-sized ambilight

If you enjoy the add-on, donations are always welcome :)

Installation
------------

The add-on depends on the XBMC add-on "requests" for the ambilight mode.

**XBMC add-on script.module.requests**

 - Download the add-on as a ZIP file from https://github.com/beenje/script.module.requests
  - (Right click on the "ZIP" icon and select "Download Linked File").
 - Open XBMC
 - Go to `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 - Select the zip file.

**XBMC add-on script.xbmc.hue.ambilight**

 - Download the add-on as a ZIP file from the top of this page
   - (Right click on the "ZIP" icon and select "Download Linked File")
 - Open XBMC
 - Go to `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 -  Restart XBMC and configure the add-on:
   - `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Enabled add-ons -> Services -> XBMC Philips Hue`
   - Run `Start auto discovery of bridge IP and User`.

Note for Raspberry Pi users:

 - Save the add-on configuration by exiting XBMC before shutting down the Pi completely
 - Ambilight mode doesn't work on a Raspberry Pi due to the way it renders video
